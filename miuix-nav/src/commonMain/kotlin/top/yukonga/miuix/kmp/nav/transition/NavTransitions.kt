/**
 * Preset library of [NavTransition]s, all implemented as pure functions of the single float
 * driver [NavTransitionScope.relativeDepth] (d = animatedTop - entryIndex).
 *
 * Every preset maps `d` to spatial graphics-layer properties only (translationX / scaleX /
 * scaleY / alpha / clip / shape) and reads `d` deferred inside the [navGraphicsTransition]
 * block, so animations cost zero recomposition. The same `d -> visual` mapping is reused by
 * both the spring-convergence path and the interactive gesture path (predictive back / edge
 * swipe), so no preset needs a separate predictive-back animation.
 *
 * Depth segments handled by each preset:
 * - `d <= 0`  : this entry is entering/leaving the top (use its own transition).
 * - `0 < d <= opaqueDepth` : this entry is covered by an upper entry (covered treatment).
 *
 * Slide-style presets keep `translation` linear in `d` (a finger-driven `snapTo` follows the finger
 * 1:1, §7.1) but snap the rendered entering offset to whole device pixels so a corner-clipped page's
 * anti-aliased edge does not shimmer under fractional-offset compositing. Parallax / dim easing may be
 * non-linear since it is identical in both drive modes.

     * Default preset. Reproduces the established miuix navigation feel: the entering page slides
     * in full-width from the trailing edge (d: -1 -> 0, translationX: +width -> 0), and the
     * covered page parallaxes a quarter width toward the leading edge with a light alpha falloff
     * (d: 0 -> 1). Geometry is linear in `d` for 1:1 finger tracking (entering offset pixel-snapped,
     * see below); RTL mirrored.
     *
     * The leading-edge corner clip and the dark scrim are NOT baked into this transition — they are
     * the orthogonal [NavDisplayEffects] layer (`enableCornerClip` + `cornerClipRadius`, `dimAmount`),
     * mirroring the reference implementation where the clip is an effect applied to the entering top.
     * Keeping it out here lets the clip radius follow the platform screen corner instead of a fixed
     * value, and avoids double-clipping when both a transition and the effect are in play.
