/**
 * Anchored gesture progress (grab-anchor model, spec 2026-06-10 §3.1 / invariant 6).
 *
 * A gesture may claim the stack while the shared spring is still mid-flight. [anchor] is the
 * progress already travelled toward pop at the claim instant (`topIndex - animatedTop.value`,
 * signed): positive when grabbed mid-push, negative when grabbed while a pop-settle is still
 * reeling a leaving entry out above the new top. The total progress is strictly additive —
 * `anchor + fingerProgress` — so the slope stays exactly 1 (1:1 with the finger, no easing on
 * this axis) and the first frame (`fingerProgress == 0`) maps back to the sampled anchor: zero
 * jump by construction.
 *
 * Clamp range:
 * - upper bound [NavDriverSpec.MAX_FINGER_PROGRESS], just under the fully-popped end (see the
 *   constant for why exactly 1 is never reachable by a finger); an `anchor > 0` grab saturates
 *   early (the page pins at the end while the finger keeps travelling), matching the reference
 *   interactive-pop feel.
 * - lower bound `min(anchor, 0f)`: with `anchor >= 0` a reverse drag can at most push the page
 *   back to rest (never into the covered regime — the static analogue of the cancel velocity
 *   clamp); with `anchor < 0` it can at most freeze the leaving entry at the grab point, never
 *   re-revealing an already-popped page (the back stack no longer holds it).
 *
 * @param anchor progress toward pop at the claim instant, signed; `0f` for a rest-state grab.
 * @param fingerProgress finger travel since the claim in progress units, unclamped.
 * @return total progress on the pop axis, in `min(anchor, 0f)..`[NavDriverSpec.MAX_FINGER_PROGRESS].
