/**
 * Interactive swipe-to-dismiss that drives `animatedTop` directly, finger-following, along the axis
 * and direction the current transition declares ([NavSwipeDirection]).
 *
 * Attached by NavDisplay to the display container (so an in-flight transition can be grabbed from
 * anywhere on screen, not just the moving top entry's translated bounds). A single unified pointer
 * handler replaces the orientation-locked
 * `detectHorizontalDragGestures` / `detectVerticalDragGestures` detectors, which only owned one axis
 * and yielded the pointer to any other consumer — the source of two defects: an in-progress dismiss
 * cancelled the instant the finger drifted onto the cross axis (a nested scroll claimed the pointer),
 * and in-page taps/scrolls fired while the gesture was driving the transition. The unified handler
 * instead works in two phases:
 *
 * 1. **Engagement** — movement is watched on [PointerEventPass.Final], after descendants had a chance
 *    to consume it on the Main pass. The first consumed non-zero position change starts a one-move
 *    confirmation window independent of navigation touch slop: another consumed position change
 *    confirms that child content owns the whole sequence, while an unconsumed change means the first
 *    consumption was only a clickable cancelling its press and navigation may claim. Either owner is
 *    then permanent until all pointers lift. A clearly cross-axis or opposite-direction drag is left
 *    to content.
 * 2. **Follow** — once claimed, **every** pointer change is consumed on **both** axes, so neither a
 *    nested scroll nor any in-page handler can act on the finger that is driving the dismiss, and a
 *    cross-axis wiggle can no longer steal or cancel the gesture. The dismiss ends **only** on finger
 *    lift; there is no cross-axis cancel path.
 *
 * [NavSwipeDirection.None] disables the gesture entirely (pop via back button / system back).
 *
 * While following, `animatedTop` is driven via [snapToFinger] to
 * `topIndex - anchoredProgress(anchor, fingerProgress)`, where `anchor` is the progress already
 * travelled toward pop at the claim instant (sampled atomically with halting any in-flight settle —
 * grab-anchor invariant 6, so interrupting a running push/pop transition is jump-free), and
 * `fingerProgress` is the recognized finger travel **in the dismiss direction beyond touch slop**
 * over the layout extent on that axis. It includes travel observed before ownership was confirmed,
 * so the page catches up without restarting at the claim event; after that it remains linear and
 * 1:1 with the finger (§7.1, no interpolation on this axis).
 *
 * On release the decision is delegated to [navBackCommitDecision] (**velocity-first,
 * position-fallback**, §7.2), using the shared thresholds [NavDriverSpec.COMMIT_VELOCITY_THRESHOLD] /
 * [NavDriverSpec.COMMIT_POSITION_THRESHOLD]. Release velocity is sampled with a [VelocityTracker]
 * (instantaneous, not a per-event delta proxy) and expressed in **progress-units per second** (axis
 * pixels/sec ÷ layout extent, signed toward the dismiss direction). That value feeds
 * [navBackCommitDecision] directly. For the convergence spring it is negated to the depth axis
 * (`animatedTop = topIndex - progress`, so depth velocity = -progress velocity) and handed to the
 * single shared spring via [settleTo]'s `initialVelocity`, making the snap -> spring handoff
 * velocity-continuous (§0.3 single spring).
 *
 * On commit [onCommit] is invoked **synchronously**, decoupled from the settle (see the release body
 * for why gating the pop behind the settle is unsafe in a per-entry coroutine scope).
 *
 * @param enabled Whether the swipe is active. Disable on the root entry (nothing to pop).
 * @param direction The dismiss axis + direction; [NavSwipeDirection.None] disables the gesture.
 * @param animatedTop The single shared depth driver.
 * @param topIndex Current top entry index being peeled away.
 * @param motion Settle physics for the release settles (commit/cancel curves); NavDisplay resolves
 *   it from the governing transition.
 * @param onCommit Invoked synchronously the moment a release is classified as a commit (pop the back
 *   stack here); the shared spring then settles `animatedTop` to the new top.
 * @param onCancel Invoked once after the cancel spring settles back to [topIndex].
 * @param onGesture Receives the live [NavGesture] context per follow event (progress, edge, touch
 *   position) for gesture-aware transitions, and `null` when the gesture has fully resolved. The
 *   last value is intentionally kept through the release settle (a transition pivoting around the
 *   touch point must not snap back to center at lift); the cancel branch clears it after its
 *   settle, the commit branch leaves clearing to the host (the leaving entry's unload).
