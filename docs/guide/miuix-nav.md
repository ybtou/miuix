# miuix-nav

`miuix-nav` is a self-contained Compose Multiplatform navigation runtime with **continuous stack depth** as its core model. The whole back stack is driven by a single `Animatable<Float>` (`animatedTop`); every entry's visuals are a pure function of its relative depth. This makes continuous push/pop, fully custom float-driven transitions, and 1:1 gesture back fall out naturally. It has **zero dependency** on `androidx.navigation3`.

## Setup

Add the dependency to your `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
implementation("top.yukonga.miuix.kmp:miuix-nav:<version>")
```

Annotate your route hierarchy with `@Serializable` so the back stack can be saved and restored across configuration changes and process death.

## Basic usage

```kotlin
import kotlinx.serialization.Serializable
import top.yukonga.miuix.kmp.nav.core.NavDisplay
import top.yukonga.miuix.kmp.nav.core.NavKey
import top.yukonga.miuix.kmp.nav.core.rememberNavBackStack
import top.yukonga.miuix.kmp.nav.transition.NavTransitions

@Serializable
sealed interface Route : NavKey {
    @Serializable data object Home : Route
    @Serializable data class Detail(val id: String) : Route
}

@Composable
fun App() {
    val backStack = rememberNavBackStack<Route>(Route.Home)
    NavDisplay(
        backStack = backStack,
        onBack = { backStack.removeLastOrNull() },
    ) {
        entry<Route.Home> {
            HomeScreen(onOpen = { id -> backStack.add(Route.Detail(id)) })
        }
        entry<Route.Detail> { route ->
            DetailScreen(route.id, onBack = { backStack.removeLastOrNull() })
        }
    }
}
```

`rememberNavBackStack` returns a `NavBackStack` (a `SnapshotStateList<NavKey>`). Operate it directly (`add` / `removeLastOrNull`) or wrap it in `NavController` for `push` / `pop` / `replace` / `popUntil`.

::: warning
`rememberNavBackStack` is `inline fun <reified T : NavKey>`. When you seed it with a single concrete key, pass the route **supertype** as the explicit type argument — `rememberNavBackStack<Route>(Route.Home)` — so the whole sealed hierarchy is serializable. Writing `rememberNavBackStack(Route.Home)` infers `T = Route.Home`, and pushing other subtypes (e.g. `Route.Detail`) will later fail to serialize for save/restore.
:::

## Continuous push and pop

Because the stack is driven by one float, pushing or popping several entries at once animates as a single continuous sweep instead of collapsing into one top-level cross-fade:

```kotlin
// Push three at once: animatedTop goes N -> N+3 over one shared spring.
backStack.add(Route.Detail("1"))
backStack.add(Route.Detail("2"))
backStack.add(Route.Detail("3"))

// Pop back to root: animatedTop goes N -> 0, continuous reverse motion.
while (backStack.size > 1) backStack.removeAt(backStack.lastIndex)
```

The reconciler classifies each change as `Push` / `Pop` / `MultiPush(n)` / `MultiPop(n)` / `Replace` / `ReplaceAll`, surfaced to transitions via `NavTransitionScope.change` so you can animate a multi-pop differently from a single pop.

## Transitions

A built-in preset library is available as `NavTransitions`:

| Preset | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `MiuixDefault` (default) | Full-width slide + quarter-width parallax + light covered alpha falloff |
| `Modal` | Bottom-up slide; lower layer stays visible |
| `None` | Instant, no animation |

The leading-edge corner clip and the dark dim scrim are not baked into any preset — they come from the orthogonal `NavDisplayEffects` layer (`enableCornerClip`, `dimAmount`; both on by default), while each transition only shapes the scrim's curve along the motion via `scrimFraction`.

Set a global default on `NavDisplay(transition = ...)` and override per route with `entry(transition = ...)`:

```kotlin
NavDisplay(backStack, transition = NavTransitions.MiuixDefault) {
    entry<Route.Home> { HomeScreen() }
    entry<Route.Detail>(transition = NavTransitions.Modal) { DetailScreen(it.id) }
}
```

## Swipe-to-dismiss direction

The interactive swipe that pops the top entry runs along the **same axis as the transition**: a horizontal slide is dismissed by a horizontal swipe, a bottom-up modal by a downward swipe. It is **opt-in** — `dismissDirection` defaults to `None` and **none of the built-in presets enable it**. Turn it on per route with `entry(swipeDismiss = ...)`, or author a transition that declares a direction.

`NavSwipeDirection` values are **physical screen directions** (which way the finger moves) and are *not* mirrored for layout direction, so pick the right one per LTR / RTL:

| Direction | Finger motion |
| :-- | :-- |
| `LeftToRight` | Rightward — the back swipe under **LTR** |
| `RightToLeft` | Leftward — the back swipe under **RTL** |
| `TopToBottom` | Downward — dismiss for a bottom-up modal |
| `BottomToTop` | Upward |
| `None` (default) | Disabled — pop via back button / system back only |

Interactive children get first refusal while a swipe is being recognized. The first consumed non-zero position change opens a one-move confirmation window, independently of navigation touch slop: another consumed position change confirms that child content owns the entire pointer sequence, while an unconsumed position change means the first consumption only cancelled a clickable press. Navigation may engage only after that provisional evidence is released and dismiss-direction travel has crossed its own touch slop. Compose consumption applies to the whole pointer change rather than one axis, so repeated consumption on any axis is conservatively treated as child ownership. Once either child content or navigation wins, ownership cannot transfer before every pointer lifts. An engaged navigation swipe consumes both axes, so a cross-axis wiggle cannot steal it or cancel mid-swipe, and in-page taps / scrolls are suppressed until release. Set or override it per route — including `NavSwipeDirection.None` to keep a route button-only:

```kotlin
import top.yukonga.miuix.kmp.nav.transition.NavSwipeDirection

NavDisplay(backStack) {
    // Enable an LTR back swipe on this route (off by default).
    entry<Route.Home>(swipeDismiss = NavSwipeDirection.LeftToRight) { HomeScreen() }
    // Bottom sheet: swipe down to dismiss.
    entry<Route.Sheet>(transition = NavTransitions.Modal, swipeDismiss = NavSwipeDirection.TopToBottom) { SheetScreen() }
    // Left untouched (default None): button-only.
    entry<Route.Confirm> { ConfirmScreen() }
}
```

A custom transition can still declare a natural direction so routes inherit it: `navGraphicsTransition(dismissDirection = NavSwipeDirection.LeftToRight) { ... }`.

## Custom transitions

Build any transition by reading the raw float depth and writing a `graphicsLayer`. The block runs inside a deferred-read layer, so reading `relativeDepth` does not recompose:

```kotlin
import top.yukonga.miuix.kmp.nav.transition.navGraphicsTransition

val myTransition = navGraphicsTransition { scope ->
    val d = scope.relativeDepth          // animatedTop - index
    translationX = -d * scope.layoutSize.width.toFloat()
    scaleX = 1f - 0.1f * d.coerceIn(0f, 1f)
    scaleY = scaleX
    cameraDistance = 16f * scope.density.density
}
```

`NavTransitionScope` exposes `relativeDepth`, `role`, `change`, `gesture`, `layoutSize`, `layoutDirection` and `density`.

Generic looks (fade, scale, shared-axis, …) are deliberately not shipped as presets — each is a few lines on this builder. A cross-fade, for instance:

```kotlin
val fade = navGraphicsTransition { scope ->
    val d = scope.relativeDepth
    alpha = if (d <= 0f) (1f + d).coerceIn(0f, 1f) else 1f - d.coerceIn(0f, 1f)
}
```

A transition also owns its **scrim curve**: the fullscreen dim rendered just beneath the top-most layer follows `NavTransition.scrimFraction` — taken from the transition governing the layer **above** (the covering entry's, the same boundary-ownership rule as the covered transform) and evaluated against the covered layer below (depth 0 = revealed, 1 = covered) — while `NavDisplayEffects.dimAmount` only caps how dark it gets. The default curve is linear in depth (the dim lightens as the layer below is revealed); pass a custom one via the `scrim` parameter, e.g. a card-style scrim that holds during a gesture and fades only across the post-commit sweep:

```kotlin
val cardStyle = navGraphicsTransition(
    scrim = { scope ->
        val d = scope.relativeDepth.coerceIn(0f, 1f)
        val g = scope.gesture
        if (g != null) (d / (1f - g.progress).coerceAtLeast(0.001f)).coerceIn(0f, 1f) else d
    },
) { scope -> /* transform */ }
```

::: tip Progress saturates below 1
`gesture.progress` never reaches exactly `1` — the driver saturates finger-driven progress just under the fully-popped boundary (also shielding devices that misreport back-gesture progress past 1). Division by `1 - progress` is therefore safe, **as long as any floor on the denominator stays at or below that headroom** (the `0.001` above). A larger floor (e.g. `0.01`) breaks the drag identity `depth == 1 - progress` in the last percent and visibly collapses the scrim on such devices.
:::

For a complete, platform-grade transition built entirely on this public API — centered scale, edge hug, damped vertical finger follow, post-commit fly-out and the gesture-held scrim above — see `CrossActivityTransition` in the example app (`example/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/navigation/CrossActivityTransition.kt`).

## Settle physics

A transition also declares its **settle physics** via `NavTransition.motion`: the timing curves used once the geometry has to converge on its own (the gesture released, or a programmatic push/pop fired). `NavMotion` keys one `NavSettleSpec` per phase:

| Phase | Runs when | Default |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `commit` | A gesture release commits the pop (predictive back / edge swipe); seeded with the release velocity when it is a `Spring` | Critically damped spring (`dampingRatio 1`, `stiffness 146`) |
| `cancel` | A gesture release cancels and the entry springs back to rest | Same spring |
| `programmatic` | A from-rest, full-step push/pop (multi-step included) | 500ms tween on the established curve (`NavProgrammaticEasing`) |

A `NavSettleSpec` is either a `Spring(dampingRatio, stiffness, clampOvershoot)` or a fixed-duration `Tween(durationMillis, easing)`:

```kotlin
val snappy = navGraphicsTransition(
    motion = NavMotion(
        // A flung release overshoots and bounces back, scaled by the throw.
        commit = NavSettleSpec.Spring(dampingRatio = 0.8f, stiffness = 280f, clampOvershoot = false),
        programmatic = NavSettleSpec.Tween(durationMillis = 450, easing = NavProgrammaticEasing),
    ),
) { scope -> /* transform */ }
```

The host resolves the motion from the **topmost presented entry's** governing transition (per-route overrides win), so during a pop the leaving entry's own motion carries its exit.

Overshoot rules:

- By default the commit settle floors its seed velocity at the exact no-overshoot bound, so navigation never bounces. Pass `clampOvershoot = false` to keep the full release velocity; an underdamped spring (`dampingRatio < 1`) overshoots by construction and **requires** that opt-out (the constructor rejects the ambiguous combination).
- The **cancel** settle always pins the rest position as a bound: input blocking, boundary ownership and the dim scrim all flip past rest, so a cancel may never cross it regardless of its spring.
- A `Tween` cannot carry a release velocity: as a commit spec it starts from the commit point with a velocity cut, and a velocity-carrying programmatic settle falls back to a spring.

### The settle context

While the driver animates on its own, the scope exposes `settle: NavSettle?` — the self-driven counterpart of `gesture` (finger driving → `gesture` non-null; settling → `settle` non-null; at rest → both null):

| Field | Meaning |
| :-- | :-- |
| `phase` | `Commit` (gesture release committed), `Cancel` (springing back) or `Programmatic` (from-rest push/pop) |
| `releaseVelocity` | The seeded release velocity, progress-units/sec toward pop; recorded even when the curve is a `Tween` (which cannot consume it) |
| `elapsedMillis` | Wall-clock since the settle started, a per-frame deferred-read source (read it inside `graphicsLayer { }`) |

This is what makes wall-clock curves and velocity overlays expressible without any extra animation machinery — an overlay spring is just closed-form math over `(releaseVelocity, elapsedMillis)`:

```kotlin
val withBounce = navGraphicsTransition(
    motion = NavMotion(commit = NavSettleSpec.Tween(450, NavProgrammaticEasing)),
) { scope ->
    val s = scope.settle
    // Deterministic track from the tween; a separate velocity-scaled bounce on top.
    if (s?.phase == NavSettlePhase.Commit) {
        val kick = (s.releaseVelocity * scope.layoutSize.width * 10f).coerceIn(0f, 1000f)
        val omega = sqrt(200f)
        val omegaD = omega * sqrt(1f - 0.75f * 0.75f)
        val t = s.elapsedMillis / 1000f
        val overlay = -(kick / omegaD) * exp(-0.75f * omega * t) * sin(omegaD * t)
        scaleX = ((100f + overlay) / 100f).coerceAtMost(1f)
        scaleY = scaleX
        // A wall-clock fade, independent of the motion easing:
        alpha = (1f - 5f * (s.elapsedMillis / 450f)).coerceAtLeast(0f)
    }
    /* depth-driven geometry as usual */
}
```

One caveat: a grab-anytime interruption replaces the settle (and restarts `elapsedMillis`); design wall-clock curves to tolerate a restart, or fall back to depth-axis formulas when `settle == null`.

## Programmatic vs. predictive transitions

By default one transition serves both drive modes — the visual is a pure function of depth, so the gesture and the programmatic settle replay the same geometry. When a design calls for **two distinct effect systems** (the platform itself animates a back-button pop and a predictive-back gesture completely differently), compose them with `navDirectionalTransition`:

```kotlin
val platformLike = navDirectionalTransition(
    push = classicOpen,          // forward changes (and replace/initial)
    pop = classicClose,          // programmatic pops; defaults to push
    predictivePop = gestureCard, // while a gesture drives; defaults to pop
)
```

Dispatch: a live gesture (predictive back or edge swipe — the context stays frozen through the whole release settle) always selects `predictivePop`; otherwise `NavChange.Pop` / `MultiPop` selects `pop`, and everything else selects `push`. Static contracts merge from their natural sources: `opaqueDepth` takes the max of the three, `dismissDirection` and the commit/cancel physics come from `predictivePop`, the programmatic curve from `pop` (`push.motion` is never consumed — use per-route overrides for route-level asymmetry).

One trade-off to know: a gesture may grab the stack mid-programmatic-settle, switching the dispatch to `predictivePop` at the grab instant. If the two branches disagree geometrically at that depth, the style jumps for one frame — author branches that stay close in the grabbable range when that matters. The example's `CrossActivityTransition` is built exactly this way: classic 450ms slide+fade for programmatic push/pop, the gesture-scaled card with a velocity-seeded bouncing commit spring for predictive back.

## Orthogonal effects

`NavDisplayEffects` holds the cross-cutting effects layered on top of the active transition, computed per depth independently of the transition itself:

| Property | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `enableCornerClip` | `true` | Clip the transitioning top entry with smooth rounded corners while it animates over the layer below |
| `cornerClipRadius` | `0.dp` | Radius of that clip; pass `rememberNavSystemCornerRadius()` to follow the device screen corner (still no rounding where the platform reports 0) |
| `cornerClipMode` | `Leading` | Which corners to round: `Leading` — the corners meeting the screen edge, for slide-style transitions; `All` — every corner, for card-style transitions that scale the whole page |
| `dimAmount` | `0.5f` | Maximum alpha of the fullscreen dim scrim beneath the top-most layer; the curve along the motion belongs to the transition (`scrimFraction`), this only caps darkness. `0f` disables |
| `blockInputDuringTransition` | `false` | Swallow touch input on mid-transition entries, so taps cannot reach a half-animated screen |
| `backdropColor` | `Unspecified` | Solid fill behind every entry layer — card-style transitions scale pages below full size, revealing the area behind the host; pass the theme background so it reads as the page extending outward |

`NavDisplayEffects.Default` is the table above; `NavDisplayEffects.None` disables everything. A card-style setup:

```kotlin
NavDisplay(
    backStack = backStack,
    effects = NavDisplayEffects(
        cornerClipRadius = rememberNavSystemCornerRadius(),
        cornerClipMode = NavCornerClipMode.All,
        dimAmount = 0.32f,
        backdropColor = MiuixTheme.colorScheme.background,
    ),
) { /* ... */ }
```

## Gesture back

Back is built in and shares the same `animatedTop` and `NavTransition` as a normal pop — by default there is no separate predictive animation to maintain (opt into a split with [`navDirectionalTransition`](#programmatic-vs-predictive-transitions)). When a gesture is in progress the finger drives `animatedTop` 1:1 (`snapTo`, no interpolator); on release a velocity-first / position-fallback decision commits or cancels, handing the lift velocity to the governing commit curve so motion stays continuous.

Two sources feed it: the **in-content swipe** (an all-platform Compose gesture, direction-aware per [Swipe-to-dismiss direction](#swipe-to-dismiss-direction) above) and the **platform back** (system predictive back / ESC / a custom trigger). Both stream into the same driver.

The **input source** and its **semantics differ per platform** — the runtime normalizes them into the same back stream, but the gesture feel is not identical everywhere:

| Platform | Source | Semantics |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Android | System predictive back | **Continuous** OS gesture: progress + swipe edge stream the whole pull; finger drives `animatedTop` 1:1, release commits/cancels with velocity handoff |
| iOS | Interactive edge swipe | **Continuous** left-edge drag implemented in-runtime; same 1:1 drive and velocity handoff as Android |
| Desktop | `ESC` key | **Discrete**, non-interactive: a key press triggers a single commit straight into the convergence spring (no per-finger progress) |
| Web | Custom source | **Caller-defined**: you feed the same back stream from your own trigger (e.g. browser back button / custom button); semantics are whatever the source provides |

## Save and restore

`rememberNavBackStack` persists the stack via `rememberSaveable` and a `kotlinx.serialization`-based saver.

::: warning
`@Serializable` is a **hard requirement** for every key in a `rememberNavBackStack` stack, not a soft hint. There are two distinct failure points: a key **type** that is not `@Serializable` throws `SerializationException` at the first composition of `rememberNavBackStack` (the serializer is captured there); a key **instance** outside the captured hierarchy — or a non-serializable subtype inside it — navigates fine all session and then throws at state-save time (on Android: when the app is backgrounded). If you cannot make keys serializable, build the stack with a plain in-memory list (`navBackStackOf`) instead of `rememberNavBackStack`.
:::

### Entry state and `contentKey`

Each entry's `rememberSaveable` state is scoped by its **contentKey** — the route value itself, unless you derive one via `entry<T>(contentKey = { route -> ... })`. Two requirements apply on top of the stack-wide uniqueness check:

- **Distinct keys must print distinct strings.** The saveable slot is keyed by the contentKey's `toString()`. Two *unequal* keys that print the same string — same-named `data class` routes in different packages (`data class` `toString()` omits the package), or an `Int 1` vs a `String "1"` returned from contentKey factories — are rejected at reconcile time with an actionable `IllegalArgumentException` instead of silently sharing and corrupting each other's saved state.
- **The string must be value-derived.** `data class` / `data object` routes qualify out of the box. A route class that keeps the default identity `toString()` (`com.app.Detail@1a2b3c`) passes every runtime check — the string is unique within the session — but resolves to a new string after process death, so the entry's `rememberSaveable` state silently resets. Stick to `data class` / `data object` routes, or return a value-derived key from the factory.

Uniqueness also makes **double taps** an app-level concern: a navigation button tapped twice in quick succession pushes the same route value twice and is rejected. Make pushes idempotent — skip keys already on the stack (see the example app's `Navigator.push`) — or give each instance a unique value.

## Entry lifecycle and ViewModels

Every entry runs under its own `LifecycleOwner` and `ViewModelStoreOwner`, so `collectAsStateWithLifecycle`, `viewModel()` and store-based DI scope per screen with no extra setup.

Lifecycle is a pure function of depth: the settled top is `RESUMED`; covered, incoming and leaving layers are `STARTED`; an entry being removed drops to `CREATED` until it unloads. While a **gesture** drives the stack, everyone is capped at `STARTED` — `RESUMED` means "settled, sole top", so work keyed on it does not flap while a finger hovers around the transition thresholds.

ViewModel stores are owned by the display, not the entry's composition: a covered entry keeps its ViewModels for as long as it stays on the back stack, and the store is cleared when the entry is popped.

## Nesting a NavDisplay

A `NavDisplay` can be nested inside an entry (tabs hosting their own stacks, a flow within a flow). Back, state and lifecycle all nest correctly:

- **Back**: each entry's back consumers (a nested display, an in-entry back handler) register under an entry-scoped dispatcher that is active only while that entry is the interactive top. The top entry's inner stack consumes back first; once the inner stack is at its root, back falls through to the outer display. A covered entry's inner stack never intercepts.
- **State**: the inner display's back stack, saveable state and ViewModels are all namespaced under the hosting entry — popping the hosting entry disposes the whole nested scope, including inner ViewModels (they live inside the hosting entry's `ViewModelStore`).
- **Lifecycle**: inner entries cap at the hosting entry's ceiling — a covered host holds everything inside it at or below `STARTED`.

One rule to know: for nested displays, the **swipe** gesture is still claimed by the outer display first when neither display's content consumes the movement. Host an interactive inner stack in the outer **root** entry (where the outer swipe is disabled anyway), or disable the outer gesture on the hosting route with `entry(swipeDismiss = NavSwipeDirection.None)`.

## Multi-pane layouts (a pattern, not an API)

The library deliberately stays a single flat stack; adaptive layouts compose **around** `NavDisplay` instead. A `NavDisplay` measures its own container, so placing it in a pane makes every transition and gesture pane-relative with no configuration:

```kotlin
if (isWideScreen) {
    Row {
        NavigationRail(...)                                    // persistent chrome
        Box(Modifier.weight(1f).clipToBounds()) { NavDisplay(backStack, ...) { ... } }
    }
} else {
    NavDisplay(backStack, ...) { ... }
}
```

Rules of the pattern, each learned the hard way:

- **Clip the pane** (`clipToBounds`): transition layers translate outside the pane (covered-page parallax, fly-outs) and would otherwise draw over the chrome next to it.
- **Zero the screen-corner clip radius in panes** (`cornerClipRadius = 0.dp`): the pane edge is mid-screen; the device corner radius belongs to physical screen edges only.
- **Drop edge insets the chrome already consumed**: a pane sitting right of a rail must not add the display-cutout start padding again.
- **Two displays under one parent are supported**: ViewModel registries are per-display, and each display's back handler arms only while its own stack has more than one entry.
- **A detail pane needs a placeholder root** — an empty back stack is rejected — and moving keys between stacks loses their state (saveable/ViewModel scopes are per-display); to survive a posture change, move the whole `NavDisplay` between layout slots with an app-level `movableContentOf` instead.

The example app's wide-screen layout (`example/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/AppContent.kt`) implements the persistent-rail variant of this pattern.

## Returning a result to a previous screen

The v1 core **does not** ship a built-in result channel (no `navigateForResult` / `setResult` on `NavController`). Keep results out of the navigation runtime and pass them with whatever state mechanism you already use, or layer a tiny result bus on top of the back stack yourself.

The recommended shape is a `requestKey`-addressed bus alongside the stack — use a `MutableSharedFlow(replay = 1)` or a buffered `Channel`, so the result emitted right before the pop is not lost if the caller screen is not actively collecting at that moment:

```kotlin
// navigateForResult(route, requestKey): push and arm a channel for requestKey.
// setResult(requestKey, value): emit on the channel, then pop.
// observeResult(requestKey): collect the result as a SharedFlow on the caller screen.
```

Port that approach (or a `SavedStateHandle`-style holder) into your own app layer; it is intentionally left out of `miuix-nav` v1 so the runtime stays a pure depth-driven stack.

## Scope and extension boundaries (v1)

`miuix-nav` v1 is deliberately a **single, flat back stack**. The following are explicitly **not supported in v1** and are deferred to v2+; do not build on them yet:

| Capability | v1 status |
| :-- | :-- |
| Dialog / bottom-sheet scene strategy (overlay destinations) | Not supported |
| Shared-element transitions across destinations | Not supported |
| KSP / annotation-based route registration | Not supported (register entries via the `entry<T> { }` DSL) |
| Built-in result channel on `NavController` | Not supported (see the section above) |

These boundaries exist so the v1 surface stays small and the continuous-depth model stays the single source of truth. They are tracked for v2+.
